# Synopsis:
# gpt generates load on GPUs for power testing. The "-u" and "-d" flags are the
# power up/down duration to facilitate generating load in the form of a square wave.
#
# mpirun
# -np N    ;total number of GPU to engage
# -H  h:n  ;comma separated host:count where sum(count) = N
# ./gpt -u <power load/up seconds> -d <no power load/down seconds> -t <total seconds-to-run>
# example:
# mpirun --allow-run-as-root -np 2 -H localhost:2 ./gpt -u 4 -d 6 -t 60
#
# The above will cycle GPU power up for 4 seconds, no load for 6 seconds continuously
# until the total 60 second run time is reached.
